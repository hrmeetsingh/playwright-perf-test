# Playwright Performance Testing Demo

This repository demonstrates how to implement performance testing using Playwright. It includes examples of measuring various performance metrics and web vitals for web applications.

## Features

- Page load time measurement using Performance Marks
- Navigation timing metrics analysis
- Image loading performance checks
- Detailed resource timing analysis
- Web Vitals monitoring (FCP, LCP, CLS)

## Setup

1. Clone the repo: 
    ```git clone https://github.com/hrmeetsingh/playwright-perf-test```
2. Install dependencies
    ```npm install```
3. Run tests
    ```npx playwright test```

## Integrations
Can be integrated in a CI/CD pipeline to run automated Web page performance tests / Client Side performance tests to avoid performance degradations in production with new code merges
